"""Drone flight simulation under wind using Genesis.

This example demonstrates how to extend a basic Genesis quadrotor example by
applying a constant wind force. The script will create a simulation, spawn a
simple quadrotor model, and step the physics while applying wind at each step.

The code relies on the external ``genesis`` package. Install it via
``pip install genesis-sim`` before running this example.
